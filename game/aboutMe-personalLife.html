                    <p class="content personalLifeText">Outside of my academic life, I like to do many things during my
                        free time. When I am on my pc, I like to play games with my boyfriend and friends. When I'm not
                        on my pc, I like to take a break by playing and hanging out with my dogs. One little short corgi
                        and beagle mix named Kobe and the other is a border collie mutt named Zico. They are so adorable
                        and cute but they can be a little chaotic sometimes. I also like to hang out with my sister and
                        mom whenever they are free. Some of my hobbies are crocheting, painting, and drawing. I usually
                        like to do this while listening to music. Some artists I like listening to is Doja Cat, Juice
                        WRLD, 80purppp, and many more. In addition, I also like watching YouTube or watching anime. Some
                        animes I've finished recently and enjoyed is <em>My Hero Academia</em>, <em>Violet
                            Evergarden</em>, and <em>Toilet-bound Hanako-kun</em>. Although I don’t do this as often as
                        I
                        used to, I always try to do it from time to time.

                    <p class="content personalLifeText">Ever since I was little, I’ve always liked doing art like
                        painting and drawing. One of my most recent projects I’ve finished is a white charcoal drawing
                        of a man on a black piece of paper. I did this project for my Art 1 class and I consider it to
                        be one of my most favorite drawings. Another piece I’ve finished recently is a black and white
                        charcoal drawing done on a gray piece of paper, consisting of 3 different sized pots and bowls.
                        This drawing was one of the simpler drawings I did but I really like the concept of drawing and
                        shading both the shadows and the highlights of the pots. In addition, some paintings I’ve
                        finished are this Bob Ross landscape painting I did in my Advanced Art class in 8th grade of a
                        forest and a waterfall flowing through it. Another painting is a Bob Ross landscape painting I
                        finished during the summer in 8th grade of a sunset on a beach. I had done this painting before
                        but I didn’t really like the result of the painting the first time so I redid it and I like the
                        outcome much better the second time. Lastly, a more hands on project I did was a slab pot I did
                        with clay inspired by the character BMO from <em>Adventure Time</em>. To see more details about
                        these projects and the other projects, come see my art portfolio.</p>

                    <p class="content personalLifeText">Whenever I have free time, I will hop on my pc to play games
                        with my boyfriend and friends. Some games I play are <em><a class="gameLink"
                                href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/"><u>Valorant</u></a></em>, which is a 5v5
                        character-based tactical FPS where precise gunplay meets unique agents with different abilities.
                        Another game I like to play is <em><a class="gameLink"
                                href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home?sessionInvalidated=true"><u>Fortnite</u></a></em>,
                        a battle royale which is like an arena where you have to be the last one standing. However,
                        unlike other battle royales, you can build which makes the game a lot harder and more
                        interesting. <em><a class="gameLink"
                                href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us"><u>Minecraft</u></a></em>,
                        a game with many different adventure modes where you build, mine, fight mobs, and explore. From
                        time to time, I will go to Steam and see what games look interesting. Some games I’ve downloaded
                        from Steam are <em><a class="gameLink" href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two"><u>It Takes
                                    Two</u></a></em>, a game where you and a friend embark on the craziest journey to
                        work together across a huge variety of challenges. <em><a class="gameLink"
                                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625450/Muck/"><u>Muck</u></a></em>, a survival
                        game where you collect resources, find items, and build a base to survive for as long as
                        possible. There are a lot more but those are the five games I played and enjoyed the most.

                    <p class="content personalLifeText">My plan for the next five years is to graduate high school and
                        get my diploma after the first year. During my senior year, I plan on getting a permit then my
                        license which will allow me to drive to and from school, home, and a part time job. I’m not sure
                        where I am going to be working but I really want a retail job at a mall or something because I
                        don’t really want to work at a fast food place but no other place accepts me. I probably will
                        have to. After graduating, I will move to Los Angeles and go to community college with my
                        boyfriend for the next two years. I’m not sure about my living space because we could move out
                        together or live with his parents. After finishing community college, I am going to transfer
                        over to a university college and currently I’m not sure what university it is going to be. While
                        I’m attending college, I am going to also want to have a part time job and hopefully a license
                        by then. After finishing college, I am going to look for a job in the computer industry.
                        Hopefully either as a web designer or a game designer. </p>
